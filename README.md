## Guess the word

A small app build with Angular2 where the user has to guess a word.
The word is saved in the local storage and a page refresh will kick in from where you left off.

### Usage
- run `npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server typings typescript` to install global dependencies
- run `npm install` to install dependencies
- run `npm start` to fire up dev server
- open browser to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
